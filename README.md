After rebuilding OS on my workstations I want to run just one command to re-configure them.

### Behind NTLM proxy
At Kaspersky Lab one cannot simply install git, ansible.  
One have to configure some sort of a proxy server (I prefer cntlm) to be able to download any packages.  
So it goes like this:
  * manually configure Mozilla's proxy settings to point to corporate proxy
  * download https://github.com/kostyrevaa/workstation/archive/master.zip
  * unzip it and run `./kick_the_automation.sh` passing IP of corporate proxy and DOMAIN as options.
  * run `source use_proxy` to export proxy settings
  > **Note:**
  > This script will
  > - download cntlm
  > - configure it
  > - configure yum (dnf) to work through the cntlm
  > - download ansible


### Run Ansible
execute `make`
